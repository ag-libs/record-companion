# AI Development Notes

## AI Assistant Used

This project was developed with assistance from **Claude Code** (Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4), an AI coding assistant.

## AI Contributions

- **Project Architecture**: Multi-module Maven structure design
- **Code Generation**: Annotation processor implementation using JavaPoet
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration test setup and validation
- **Documentation**: README, build instructions, and code formatting guidelines

## Human Oversight

All AI-generated code was reviewed and validated through:
- Compilation verification
- Test execution and validation
- Code structure and naming consistency checks
- Maven build process verification

## Development Approach

The AI assistant helped accelerate development by:
1. Setting up the complete project structure efficiently
2. Implementing annotation processing patterns correctly
3. Creating comprehensive test coverage
4. Establishing proper documentation and build practices

This collaboration demonstrates effective human-AI partnership in software development.
